            <p>To prepare the BEST Food in 30 minutes, all you need is a stir-fry pan (wok), leftover cooked rice, and chicken, whether you're a newbie cook with limited resources or a busy mom with hungry goblins lurking around.</p>

            <h4>Our Fried Rice Recipe</h4>
        <p>Rice, eggs, and oil are the main ingredients in homemade fried rice. For a decreased moisture level, the rice should be cooked 1 to 3 days ahead of time. (Find out how to cook rice on the stove, in a rice cooker, or in the microwave using these tried-and-true ways.) The remainder is flexible and adjustable to suit any taste or culture. Fried rice was created to breathe new life into leftovers, and it accomplishes just that!</p>

                <h4>Chicken Fried Rice Recipe</h4>
                <p>Chicken Fried Rice is a delicious Chinese stir-fry rice dish with a variety of colorful veggies, chicken, and an egg. It's one of the most soothing gluten-free one-pot meals I've ever had. Fried rice is one of my favorite dishes because it can be prepared in under 30 minutes. One of the best ways to use up leftover rice and vegetables in the fridge is to make this dish.</p></div>
